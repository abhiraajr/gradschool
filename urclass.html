A wanted one was new Geometry Dash Levels, now Geometry Dash Levels 4-13 & 16-21 are here in Computer Games!  Those were not the only games added, a new game called 3D Tennis and Retrobowl NFL Football, but these games are in Premium Games because of how good they are and the quality. The next version is v0.4 with a cloaking mechanism, and the settings page will be updated from a blank page to a regular page with new features!"
